 **Purpose**
 * WM: This is meant basically for "endless" card scenarios, like an "infinite" No. of users, of purchase items, of houses, of articles in catallog, etc.
 * Not so much as an entry menu for a web page where the quantity of cards is pretty much fixed.
 * For entry menus use mat-card plus mat-Flex-Layout, see

 TODO:
 * User removal-icon-button "-" to make cards active and inactive (blurred)
    * Purpose on non-infinite list: Disabled menu entry
    * Purpose on infinite list: Disabled users, etc.
    
 * Put X icon-button onto card to erase infinite list items
 
 
 Router: click on cards to show full-screen but maintain sidenav.
